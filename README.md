### Quick start

Zercurity uses both [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to install and manage your Zercurity installation.

Once installed. Run `./setup.sh` this simply configures the `production.env` file used for configuring the containers managed by `docker-compose`.

```
./setup.sh
```

Zercurity should now be accessible via `https://app.zercurity.local` or the provided domain.

#### Getting started

To create your initial user account you can either register a new account via the app. Or if
you want to skip the initial email check use this command to generate a signup link:

```
docker exec zercurity_backend_1 ./zercurity --register --name "Your name" --email "your@email.com"
```

#### Updating

```
./update.sh
```
